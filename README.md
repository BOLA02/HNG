# Profile Card with Dynamic UTC Time

## Overview

This project displays a simple profile card with a user's picture, name, job title, short bio, location, email, and social media links. It also dynamically updates and displays the current UTC time on the profile card. The card has hover effects for an interactive experience.

## Features

- **Profile Card Layout**: The profile card displays the user's details in a clean, modern design.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effect on the profile card and social media links.
- **Dynamic UTC Time**: The current UTC time is displayed and updated every second.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is centered and scales appropriately for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page and content layout.
- **CSS**: Styles for the profile card and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic update of UTC time.

## Installation

To use the profile card, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the profile card structure and references to external styles and scripts.
- `css/main.css`: The stylesheet defining the styles for the profile card.
- `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles updating the UTC time.

## Usage

- **Profile Card**: The profile card contains the following information:
    - **Profile Picture**: The user's profile picture (replace the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag with a valid image URL).
    - **Full Name**: The user's name (can be modified inside the `<h2>` tag).
    - **Job Title**: The user's job title (can be modified inside the `<h3>` tag).
    - **Short Bio**: A brief description about the user.
    - **Location and Email**: Displayed in the respective `<p>` tags.
    - **Social Links**: Links to the user's social media profiles (replace the `href` attributes with actual URLs).

- **UTC Time**: The time in UTC will update every second and is displayed below the social media links.

## Customization
